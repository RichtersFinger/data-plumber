### Stage

[Documentation](../README.md#documentation)

A `Stage` represents a single building block in the processing logic of a `Pipeline`. It provides a number of `Callable`s that are used in a `Pipeline.run`. The arguments that are passed into those `Callable`s vary. Below a list of all keywords that can occur is given (most `Callable`s receive only a subset of these):
* all kwargs given to `Pipeline.run` are forwarded (note that this makes the following arguments reserved words in this context),
* **out** (a persistent data-object that is passed through the entire `Pipeline`; its initial value is generated by the `Pipeline`'s `initialize_output`),
* **primer** (output of `Stage.primer`),
* **status** (output of `Stage.status`),
* **count** (index of `Stage` in execution of `Pipeline`)

#### Stage properties
`Stage`s accept a number of different (optional) arguments that are mostly `Callable`s to be used by a `Pipeline` during execution.
* **requires** -- requirements for `Stage`-execution being either `None` (always run this `Stage`) or a dictionary with pairs of references to a `Stage` and the required status (uses most recent evaluation);

  key types are either `StageRef`, `str` (identifier of a `Stage` in the context of a `Pipeline`), or `int` (relative index in `Pipeline` stage arrangement);

  values are either an integer or a `Callable` taking the status as an argument and returning a `bool` (if it evaluates to `True`, the `Stage`-requirement is met)

* **primer** `Callable` for pre-processing data

  (kwargs: `out`, `count`)

* **action** `Callable` for main-step of processing

  (kwargs: `out`, `primer`, `count`)

* **export** `Callable` that returns a dictionary of additional kwargs to be exported to the parent `Pipeline`; in the following `Stage`s, these kwargs are then available as if they were provided with the `Pipeline.run`-command

  (kwargs: `out`, `primer`, `count`)

* **status** `Callable` for generation of a `Stage`'s integer exit status

  (kwargs: `out`, `primer`, `count`)

* **message** `Callable` for generation of a `Stage`'s exit message

  (kwargs: `out`, `primer`, `count`, `status`)
